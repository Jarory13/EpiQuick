Summary:
Giardiasis is a diarrheal disease caused by the microscopic parasite Giardia. A parasite is an organism that feeds off of another to survive. Once a person or animal (for example, cats, dogs, cattle, deer, and beavers) has been infected with Giardia, the parasite lives in the intestines and is passed in feces (poop).

Incubation period: 1 - 3 weeks.

Symptoms:
Diarrhea
Gas or flatulence
Greasy stool that can float
Stomach or abdominal cramps
Upset stomach or nausea
Dehydration

Last 2 - 6 weeks

Those at Risk:
Travelers to countries where giardiasis is common
People in childcare settings
Those who are in close contact with someone who has the disease
People who swallow contaminated drinking water
Backpackers or campers who drink untreated water from lakes or rivers
People who have contact with animals who have the disease
Men who have sex with men

Treatment:
Several drugs can be used to treat Giardia infection. Effective treatments include metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide. Alternatives to these medications include paromomycin, quinacrine, and furazolidone. Some of these drugs may not be routinely available in the United States.  It is important to discuss treatment options with a healthcare provider.

Preventative Measures:
Practice good hygiene.
Avoid water (drinking and recreational) that may be contaminated.
